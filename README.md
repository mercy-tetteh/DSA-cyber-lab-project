This repository contains my final project on building a virtual cybersecurity lab and conducting Android forensics.


Title: Building a Virtual Cybersecurity Laboratory and Conducting Android Forensics Investigations  
Author: Mercy Tetteh

# Project Overview

This project was completed as part of a 3-month cybersecurity training program. It demonstrates hands-on knowledge in setting up a virtual cybersecurity environment and performing Android mobile forensic investigations using real tools and techniques.

# Project Structure

# Part I – Virtual Cyber Lab Setup
- Set up Kali Linux (attacker) and Windows 10 (target) on VMware.
- Configured internal networking between both VMs.
- Verified network connectivity using ping and basic enumeration.

# Part II – Android Forensic Analysis
- Analyzed a provided Android forensic image using Autopsy.
- Extracted digital evidence including:
  - SMS messages
  - Call logs
  - Installed apps
  - Browser history
  - Crypto wallet activity
- Compiled a full PDF report documenting methodology, findings, screenshots, and professional recommendations.

# Part III – Virtual Firewall (Skipped)
Due to technical constraints, the firewall implementation was not completed. However, it remains a recommended next step for future enhancement.

# Files Included
- `Android_Forensics_Report.pdf` – Full analysis report with screenshots and conclusions.
- `Lab_Setup_Screenshots/` – Screenshots showing lab configuration steps.
- *(Optional future)*: `pfSense_Setup_Guide.md` – Placeholder for firewall documentation.

# Tools Used

- VMware Workstation : Virtual environment setup
- Kali Linux & Windows 10 : Test machines
- Autopsy 4.21.0 : Android forensic analysis
- Wireshark : (Optional) Network traffic monitoring
- Google & YouTube : For research and troubleshooting
